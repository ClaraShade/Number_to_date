# Number_to_date
For my professional use, I needed to extract a date from serial number of the product.
The serial number looks like this "YYMMDDXXX", the first six digits correspond to date of production,
the last three digits are the number of panel in the LOT.
I took a file with bunch of serial numbers and created file with corresponding dates.
